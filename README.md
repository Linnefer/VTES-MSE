The proper fonts for VTES are (based on https://rec.games.trading-cards.jyhad.narkive.com/haqC0iHK/vtes-font ):

* Name: Matrix-ExtraBold
* Card text: Gill Sans MT
* Capacity: ITC Quorum Std Medium

They are **not** included in this archive.

Helpful notes:
* library cards are a little funky with the disciplines and clan markers: clan icons are larger and can be clicked on on the *right*, the disciplines are smaller and *atop* the clan markers. The lower clan marker *also* serves as the flight marker's position. Assamite clan markers are **separate** and exist in 3 variants (bottom, mid, top) - you can click that field above the upper clan marker.
* library cards follow the *2020* design of filling disciplines / burn bottom to top, not the 1994 design of top to bottom.

Todo:
* Implement Twin-Type Library Cards

The proper fonts for VTES are (based on https://rec.games.trading-cards.jyhad.narkive.com/haqC0iHK/vtes-font ):

* Name: Matrix-ExtraBold
* Card text: Gill Sans MT
* Capacity: ITC Quorum Std Medium

They are in the VTES-Fonts folder to be installed manually.

Helpful notes:
* library cards are a little funky with the disciplines and clan markers:
  * The first discipline marker *also* serves as the flight marker and as the 2nd clan marker. Choosing a clan hides the 2nd discipline marker and jumps directly to the 3rd!
  * Assamite clan markers are **separate** and exist in 3 variants (bottom, mid, top) - you can click that field above the upper clan marker or right of the 1st Discipline. The Lower position *overwrites* two discipline dots, the *middle* position overwrites the normal clan position!
  * For easier working, the V5 "square" Assamite Icon is available as an alternative for Library cards.
* library cards follow the *1994* design of filling disciplines / burn top to bottom, not the 2020 cardmaker design of bottom to top.

Todo:
* Implement Twin-Type Library Cards
